      "message": "The previous way does always return a full-path (no a physical path). But there is no need for a full-path. If you want a full-path the standard approach is $(readlink -f $(dirname $0)). Actually this is even better in that it generates the physical path.\n\nThe previous way does work when a script is being sourced instead of being executed. Don\u0027t even get me started on the evils of sourcing scripts.\n\nThe previous way is quite obfuscated, I have never seen it before and it took me a several minutes to figure out what was happening. The use of $0 is ubiquitous and you never think twice when you see it.\n\nBTW one thing that does cause problems with either approach is soft links. If the script is executed through a soft-link you will get the link dir. Using $(readlink -f $(dirname $0)) solves that problem.",
