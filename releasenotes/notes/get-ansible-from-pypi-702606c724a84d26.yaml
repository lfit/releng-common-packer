prelude: >
  Install ansible and ansible-playbook using PyPI.
issues:
  - |
    Error:
      Problem: package ansible-5.4.0-3.el8.noarch requires
      (ansible-core >= 2.12.2 with ansible-core < 2.13), but none
      of the providers can be installed
fixes:
  - |
    Install ansible through system packages causes dependencies
    conflicts on CentOS 8 platform therefore update packer
    templates to use ansible provisioner created through venv.
