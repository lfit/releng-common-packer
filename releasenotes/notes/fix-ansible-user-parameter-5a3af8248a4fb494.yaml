    Fix Ansible provisioner user parameter in OpenStack templates.
    
    The Ansible provisioner in OpenStack templates (builder.pkr.hcl,
    docker.pkr.hcl, devstack.pkr.hcl, devstack-pre-pip-yoga.pkr.hcl, and
    windows-builder.pkr.hcl) was missing the ``user`` parameter, causing
    Ansible to default to the wrong user account when connecting to
    instances through SSH.
    
    This resulted in SCP failures during the "Gathering Facts" task with
    errors like:
    
    .. code-block:: text
    
       fatal: [default]: FAILED! => {}
       MSG:
       failed to transfer file to /home/runner/.ansible/tmp/...
       scp: dest open '~runner/.ansible/tmp/...': No such file or directory
    
    **Root Cause**: During the HCL2 conversion (commit 6e2fdc9), AWS
    templates were created with ``user = "${var.ssh_user}"`` but OpenStack
    templates were not. This was an oversight that went undetected until
    Ansible provisioning was tested through bastion/jump hosts in CI/CD
    environments.
    
    **Resolution**: Added ``user = "${var.ssh_user}"`` parameter to the
    Ansible provisioner block in all affected OpenStack templates. This
    ensures Ansible uses the correct SSH user (ubuntu/centos/cloud-user)
    as defined in the respective vars files.
    
    **Backward Compatibility**: This change is fully backward compatible:
    
    - The ``ssh_user`` variable already exists in all vars files
    - AWS templates already use this pattern successfully
    - No changes required to existing Jenkins jobs or workflows
    - The fix aligns OpenStack templates with the existing AWS template pattern
    
    Templates updated:
    
    - templates/builder.pkr.hcl
    - templates/docker.pkr.hcl
    - templates/devstack.pkr.hcl
    - templates/devstack-pre-pip-yoga.pkr.hcl
    - templates/windows-builder.pkr.hcl
