    Using ansible_facts does not match/return the minor versions of the
    Repoid. For CentOS 8.2.2004 and earlier versions uses repoid as
    'PowerTools' while CentOS 8.3.2011 and later versions uses repoid as
    'powertools'. To handle this, check the repo file name under
    /etc/yum.repos.d/ and enable the correct repository.
