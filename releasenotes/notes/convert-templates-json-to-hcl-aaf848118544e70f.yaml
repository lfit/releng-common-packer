  As of packer version 1.7.0 HCL2 is the preferred way to write Packer
  templates. HCL2 preserves existing workflows while leveraging HCL2â€™s
  advanced features like variable interpolation and configuration
  composability.
upgrade:
  - |
    Migrate packer templates from JSON to HCL2 format. JSON format templates
    are deprecated and no longer works with packer version > 1.9.x.

    Existing JSON templates can be converted to '.pkr.hcl' using:

    .. code-block:: bash

       packer hcl2_upgrade -with-anotations <folder|filename>

    Packer version 1.9.1 will be minimum required version for packer jobs.
    This version requires installing the cloud specific plugin through
    packer config and needs to be initalize and download before running
    `packer build`.

    `<temmplate>.pkr.hcl` includes the sources and builds are defined.
    `.auto.pkrvars.hcl` includes variables that are loaded automatically.
    These variables load automatically from the same directory and are common
    across templates. `variables.pkr.hcl` includes variable declarations that
    are common across templates.

issues:
  - |
    Add support for host key algorithms to work with local ssh proxy
    without which packer builds results in "failed to handshake" error.
    Workaround is to pass additional params with "extra_arguments".

deprecations:
  - |
    Support for '.json' templates will be removed from common-packer in
    subsequent release to give enough time for projects consuming to upgrade.
    All projects specific templates not available in this repository are
    required to convert existing '.json' to '.pkr.hcl' format.
