    Fixed compatibility with Packer 1.11.x by adding explicit plugin
    declarations to all template files. Packer 1.11.x introduced stricter
    plugin validation requiring all plugins to be declared in
    ``required_plugins`` blocks.

    Updated templates with required_plugins blocks:

    - builder.pkr.hcl (openstack, docker, ansible)
    - docker.pkr.hcl (openstack, docker, ansible)
    - devstack.pkr.hcl (openstack, docker, ansible)
    - devstack-pre-pip-yoga.pkr.hcl (openstack, docker, ansible)
    - windows-builder.pkr.hcl (openstack, ansible)
    - builder-aws.pkr.hcl (amazon, ansible)
    - docker-aws.pkr.hcl (amazon, ansible)

    This fix maintains backward compatibility with Packer 1.9.x and 1.10.x
    while ensuring builds work correctly with Packer 1.11.x and future
    versions. The GitHub Actions workflow already includes the necessary
    ``packer init`` command to download plugins.

    Added .packer.d/ directory to .gitignore to exclude plugin cache.

    No action required for existing deployments. All changes are backward
    compatible with Packer 1.9.x and 1.10.x. If upgrading to or using
    Packer 1.11.x, ensure ``packer init`` is run before ``packer build``
    or ``packer validate`` to download the required plugins (this is
    already handled in the CI/CD workflow).
