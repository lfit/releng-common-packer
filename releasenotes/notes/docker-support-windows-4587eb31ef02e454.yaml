    Feat: Add support for Docker builder on Windows

    The original change e24c07369afd514abdf3efb0f596f772261412ed
    missed updating arm64 var files, while the builder templates were
    updated. This breaks the packer verify jobs.

    Error:

        required variable not set: docker_source_image'
