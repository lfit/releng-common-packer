    Set packer builder type with environment variable

    Using the -only CLI option for packer build does not work as expected.
    The #CR 90dd675df482a8 (global-jjb) submitted with common-packer v0.7.0
    fails to build packer jobs because of a bug in the packer build CLI.

    The `-only` option packer build CLI does not set the cloud provider
    name/type as per the documentation. The alternative is to use an environment
    variable that is passed through the packer job and can be reference in the
    packer templates.
