    Import correct GPG keys for sigul and EL8

    Sigul 1.1.1 is signed by the Fedora infrastructure GPG key
    therefore import the Fedora infra key before installing
    the updated version on Sigul for CentOS8.

    Import the EL8 GPG keys without which would fail
    while installing several dependencies.
