    Deprecate JSON format var and templates

    With the release of common-paker v0.14.0 (commit 6e2fdc9fb5be1d9843d14b6a)
    the packer version v1.9.x supports only HCL format templates and var files.
    These older JSON format files are no longer used with the packer
    verify and merge jobs.

    All  packer templates have been migrated from JSON to HCL2 format
    with v0.14.X release.

    JSON format templates are deprecated and no longer used with packer
    version > 1.9.x. Therefore remove the deprecated files from the repository.
