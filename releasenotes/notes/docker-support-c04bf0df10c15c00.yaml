    Docker image builds are now supported by the packer templates.
upgrade:
  - |
    Requires first upgrading global-jjb to version _____ to pull in support for
    selecting a packer-builder in the packer-merge jobs, otherwise existing
    project packer-merge job builds *may* fail without the global-jjb updates
    if builds are run on a Jenkins node that does not support Docker.
