features:
  - |
    Docker image builds are now supported by the packer templates.
upgrade:
  - |
    Requires first upgrading global-jjb to version _____ to pull in support for
    selecting a packer-builder in the packer-merge jobs, otherwise existing
    project packer-merge job builds *may* fail without the global-jjb updates
    if builds are run on a Jenkins node that does not support Docker.
  - |
    Projects using AWS must ensure that the packer-merge jobs are updated to
    set *packer-builder* to aws.

    Example:

    .. code-block:: yaml
        :emphasize-lines: 19

        - project:
            name: packer-builder-jobs
            jobs:
              - gerrit-packer-merge

            project: releng/builder
            project-name: builder
            branch: master
            archive-artifacts: "**/*.log"

            build-node: centos7-builder-2c-1g
            build-timeout: 90
            cron: "00 H 1 * *"

            platforms:
              - centos-7
              - centos-8

            packer-builder: aws
            templates: builder
            update-cloud-image: true
