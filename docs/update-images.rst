Upload Linux cloud image for packer jobs
########################################

The following instructions provide details on how to update a base image in
OpenStack cloud.

1. Ask an administrator for the required ~/.config/openstack/ files
1. Install prerequisites

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install lftools[openstack]
      yum/apt install qemu-img


2. Fetch the image file in .img format
3. Vexxhost requires images to be uploaded in RAW format so QCOW2 images need to be converted to RAW:


   .. code-block:: bash

       qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64-raw.img

3. upload it to the cloud in question

   .. code-block:: bash

       lftools openstack --os-cloud "cloudname" image upload --disk-format raw local-server-cloudimg-arm64-raw.img "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS [2020-08-04]"

4. Update common-packer to use this new image.

eg edit: vars/ubuntu-18.04.json
once that is merged tag common packer with the new version

   .. code-block:: bash

       git tag -s v0.6.2 -m  "common-packer v0.6.2 release"
       git push origin v0.6.2

5. pull common packer changes into global-jjb of your project

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd packer/common-packer/
       git checkout git checkout v0.6.2

6. once your change is merged re-run one of the packer merge jobs it will use
the new base image.

##################################################################
Update Packer Images to reflect changes in LF ansible galaxy roles
##################################################################

Workflow:

Change is merged to an ansible role:
https://gerrit.linuxfoundation.org/infra/c/ansible/roles/lf-recommended-tools/+/16671

Now we want the images in our "umbrella-project's" openstack cloud to have these changes:

Find the packer merge jobs in our umbrella project's jenkins.
Trigger this job for each builder you want to be able to update.

https://jenkins.umbrella-name.org/search/?q=packer-merge

    ci-management-packer-merge-centos-7-docker
    ci-management-packer-merge-centos-7-builder
    ci-management-packer-merge-ubuntu-18.04-docker
    ci-management-packer-merge-ubuntu-18.04-builder


Trigger a merge job for each builder that we want to update.
https://jenkins.acumos.org/job/ci-management-packer-merge-centos-7-builder/

Or if you dont have trigger:

you can run a remerge via comment on a change (anyone can do this) to for example:
umbrella-project/ci-management/packer/vars/centos-7.json

example:
https://gerrit.acumos.org/r/c/ci-management/+/5041/1/packer/vars/centos-7.json

and that will trigger both builds:
ci-management-packer-merge-centos-7-docker
ci-management-packer-merge-centos-7-builder


When the job is complete, you will see some info in the Build history

Which will look like this:

   .. code-block:: bash

       Image: ZZCI - CentOS 7 - builder - x86_64 - 20190910-180457.538

Or there is an openstack command for admins.

   .. code-block:: bash

       openstack --os-cloud="odlci" image list

Take this information and update a file in your ci-managment repo
umbrella-project/ci-management/jenkins-config/clouds/openstack/UMBRELLA-PROJECT-VEX/
for example:
centos7-builder-2c-1g.cfg

   .. code-block:: bash

       IMAGE_NAME=ZZCI - CentOS 7 - builder - 20181115-0246
       LABELS=centos7-basebuild-4c-4g
       HARDWARE_ID=v3-standard-4

In this case you would also want to update
centos7-builder-4c-4g.cfg

Replace the IMAGE_NAME with the string retreived from the ci-management-packer-merge-centos-7-builder job.
Once that is merged the new image will be used when that builder is spawned.

Some info on the jenkins side of this about the  ci-management-packer-merge jobs:
